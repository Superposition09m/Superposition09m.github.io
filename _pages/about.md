I am a third-year undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests lie broadly in deep learning, spanning both theory and applications. I am particularly interested in understanding the **mechanisms** behind deep learning models. Additionally, I am interested in **empirical methodology**, believing that intelligence can be understood through construction.

Regarding the working principles of deep learning models, I am currently focusing on **mechanistic interpretability** of LLMsâ€”a rapidly growing research area that aims to reverse-engineer the internal operations of neural networks to uncover how they function. On the empirical side, I plan to explore aspects such as **RL** and **foundation models** in the future.

I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/), who provides me with invaluable guidance and support. I am also grateful to [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/), who mentors me in the fascinating world of deep learning and interpretability, offering many opportunities to explore this field. I am also very grateful for the support and encouragement from many seniors and peers, who help me grow and improve continuously.
