I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Science & Technology and minoring in ACEE, Chu Kochen Honors College. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sharon Yixuan Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/index.html), Prof. [Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/), and Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/).

Recently, my research philosophy has undergone a significant evolution from Deconstruction to Construction. Previously, I focused on Interpretability and Trustworthy ML, driven by a desire to decipher the "physics" of neural networks and ensure their controllability.

Now, my research interests have shifted toward new model architectures (e.g., Sparse/Linear Attention, DeltaNet) and new learning paradigms (e.g., Continual Learning, Test-time Learning), grounded in two core beliefs:

- *Understanding through construction, not just deconstruction.* As Richard Feynman famously said: "What I cannot create, I do not understand." 
- *The next paradigm won't emerge from reverse-engineering Transformers alone.* Relying solely on that path risks trapping our understanding in the local minima of existing frameworks.

While this represents a substantial shift in direction and I am still in an exploratory phase, I believe my previous research experience provides valuable priors for this new terrain. My long-term goal is to build models with true agency and efficiency.
