I am a third-year undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am interested in **deep learning**, particularly in **interpreting models** and **developing theoretical foundations for them**. My long-term goal is to understand **the mechanisms of neural networks**, transforming deep learning from a "black box" approach into a rigorous **science**. I am also interested in topics such as \textbf{alignment} and \textbf{trustworthiness} in AI systems, with the aim of ensuring that AI technologies are beneficial to society.

Currently, I am focusing on **mechanistic interpretability** in large language models (LLMs), a rapidly growing area of research that seeks to reverse-engineer the internal operations of neural networks to uncover how they function. Unlike learning theory, which emphasizes formal and mathematical frameworks, mechanistic interpretability takes an approach closer to the "physics" of LLMs. I believe that both **formal theoretical approaches** and **mechanistic discoveries**—viewed through a physical lens—are essential for achieving a comprehensive understanding of neural networks.

I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/), who provides me with invaluable guidance and support. I am also grateful to [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/), who mentors me in the fascinating world of deep learning and interpretability, offering many opportunities to explore this field. I am also very grateful for the support and encouragement from many seniors and peers, who help me grow and improve continuously.
